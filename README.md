# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation Using RFM Analysis and KMeans Clustering

This project involves unsupervised customer segmentation on the Online Retail dataset using **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** analysis and **KMeans clustering**. The objective is to identify meaningful customer groups to improve marketing strategies, customer retention, and lifetime value.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

Businesses often have thousands of customers and need a strategy to understand different types of buyers. This project uses machine learning techniques to:

- Group customers into similar segments
- Identify high-value, loyal, and at-risk customers
- Support data-driven marketing decisions

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is the **Online Retail Dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository or Kaggle. It contains transactional data for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail company.

| Attribute | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| InvoiceNo | Unique identifier for transactions |
| StockCode | Product/item code |
| Description | Item name |
| Quantity | Quantity of each product per transaction |
| InvoiceDate | Date and time of invoice |
| UnitPrice | Price per item |
| CustomerID | Unique customer ID |
| Country | Country of customer |

---

## 🧮 Methodology

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Removed null `CustomerID` values
- Filtered out canceled orders (invoices starting with 'C')
- Kept only positive `Quantity` and `UnitPrice`

### 2. RFM Feature Engineering
- **Recency**: Days since last purchase
- **Frequency**: Number of purchases
- **Monetary**: Total spend

### 3. Data Scaling
- Applied `StandardScaler` to normalize RFM values

### 4. Clustering
- Used the Elbow Method to identify the optimal number of clusters
- Applied `KMeans` for segmentation

### 5. Segment Analysis
- Segmented customers into distinct behavioral groups
- Summarized each segment with average RFM values and customer count

---

## 📈 Results

Customers were segmented into distinct groups such as:

- 🎯 **Loyal Customers**: High frequency, low recency, high spend
- ⚠️ **At-Risk Customers**: High recency, low frequency
- 💸 **Big Spenders**: High monetary value
- 🌱 **New/Low-Value Customers**: Low frequency and spend

Each cluster provides actionable insights for targeted marketing.
